## ‚ú® Features

### üé® Fractal Visualization
- **Mandelbrot Set**: Set c = 0 to explore the classic Mandelbrot fractal where each pixel represents a different starting point
- **Julia Sets**: Use non-zero values of c to generate beautiful Julia set fractals with fixed constants
- **Real-time Rendering**: Watch fractals update instantly as you adjust parameters

### üéõÔ∏è Interactive Controls
- **Complex Parameter Control**: Adjust both real and imaginary parts of the complex constant c
- **Iteration Depth**: Control fractal detail with adjustable maximum iterations (10-200)
- **Zoom & Pan**: Explore fractal details with zoom functionality
- **Color Schemes**: Choose from multiple beautiful color palettes:
  - Classic (blue-orange gradient)
  - Fire (red-yellow-white)
  - Ocean (blue-cyan tones)
  - Psychedelic (rainbow patterns)

### üé¨ Animation
- **Dynamic Animation**: Watch fractals morph continuously as parameters change
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fluid animation between different fractal states

## üéì How It Works

### Mathematical Foundation
The visualizer implements the iterative formula:
```
f(z) = z¬≤ + c
```

Where:
- **z** is a complex number representing the current point
- **c** is a complex constant that determines the fractal type
- The iteration continues until either the magnitude exceeds 2 or maximum iterations are reached

### Fractal Types

#### Mandelbrot Set (c = 0 + 0i)
- Each pixel represents a different value of the complex constant c
- Shows which values of c produce bounded sequences
- Creates the iconic "bug-like" shape with intricate boundary details

#### Julia Sets (c ‚â† 0)
- Each pixel represents a different starting point z‚ÇÄ
- The complex constant c remains fixed across the entire image  
- Produces connected, often symmetric fractal patterns
- Different values of c create dramatically different Julia sets

### Color Mapping
Points are colored based on how quickly they escape to infinity:
- **Black**: Points that remain bounded (part of the fractal set)
- **Colored**: Points that escape, with color intensity based on escape speed
- **Multiple Schemes**: Different algorithms create varied aesthetic effects

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Canvas Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas with ImageData for pixel-level control

## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Basic Controls

1. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to modify the real and imaginary parts of c
2. **Change Detail Level**: Increase max iterations for more fractal detail (warning: higher values slower)
3. **Zoom**: Use the zoom slider to explore fractal regions in detail
4. **Switch Colors**: Select different color schemes from the dropdown
5. **Animate**: Click the animate button to see continuous parameter changes

### Tips for Exploration

- Start with presets to see interesting fractal regions
- Gradually adjust parameters to see smooth transitions
- Higher iteration counts reveal more detail but render slower
- Try different color schemes to highlight different features
- Use zoom to explore the infinite detail at fractal boundaries

### Performance Optimization

- Lower iteration counts for smoother real-time interaction
- Higher iteration counts for detailed static images
- Animation automatically uses moderate settings for smooth playback
